# haskell-brainfuck

This is a brainfuck interpreter written in Haskell, meaning the implementation is completely pure. This is interesting because brainfuck is essentially just a turing machine, and Haskell is essentially just lambda calculus. In a way, this kind of demonstrates their equivalency.
